**Optional Component Disabling Now Works Correctly**

Setting `dot-ai-controller.enabled: false` or `dot-ai-ui.enabled: false` now properly prevents those components from being rendered. Previously, the Helm chart dependencies lacked `condition` fields, so these settings had no effect and all resources were always deployed.

This fix resolves drift detection issues in GitOps tools like Flux and ArgoCD, which would report removed resources when users attempted to disable components that were previously deployed. Both components default to `enabled: true`, so existing deployments are unaffected.
