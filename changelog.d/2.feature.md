**Configurable Timing Parameters for Resource Sync and Capability Scan**

Control how frequently dot-ai synchronizes resources and scans cluster capabilities. Previously, these operations used fixed timing intervals, which could be too frequent for large clusters or too slow for rapidly changing environments.

ResourceSyncConfig now supports `debounceWindowSeconds` (default: 10s, max: 300s) to control how long to wait after a change before syncing, and `resyncIntervalMinutes` (default: 60m, max: 1440m) to set the interval between full resyncs. CapabilityScanConfig supports `debounceWindowSeconds` with the same defaults. Both parameters are optional—omit them to use the defaults.

Configure these values in your Helm values file:
```yaml
resourceSync:
  enabled: true
  debounceWindowSeconds: 30
  resyncIntervalMinutes: 120

capabilityScan:
  enabled: true
  debounceWindowSeconds: 30
```
